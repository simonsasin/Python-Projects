# Python-Projects
Several Different Projects I have done in Python. Contents include selection structure and boolean logic, 
repetition structure, modularization techniques, file application/exceptions, Python list and tuples, 
Class and Object-Oriented Programming. 
These projects were done in an Entry Level Python Programming Class at Purdue.
